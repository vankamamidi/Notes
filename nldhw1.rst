ME 7160: Nonlinear Dynamics and Vibration Homework 1
------------------------------------------------------

Solve the following differential equations and plot their solutions
for sufficient time to assure an understanding of their long-term
behavior. They plots also shouldn't be unreasonably long. A plot that
goes too long shows you needed way too much information to understand
the trend. This will require judgement and multiple plots on screen to
obtain good settings. Print and turn in only a final plot that illustrates the behaviors. 

#. Solve the following for :math:`x(t)`. Plot the solution, labelling
   axes, for sufficient duration to show the salient
   features. Identify, as appropriate, the damping ratio, time
   constant, settling time, and natural frequency. Use
   
   #. :math:`\dot{x}+x=0`, :math:`x_0=5`
   #. :math:`10\ddot{x}+1\dot{x}+100x=0`, :math:`x_0=5, \dot{x}_0=2`
   #. :math:`\dot{x}+10x=2`, :math:`x_0=1`
   #. :math:`10\ddot{x}+2\dot{x}+100x=200`, :math:`x_0=0, \dot{x}_0=0`

#. Plot the free response, labelling
   axes, for sufficient duration to show the salient
   features. Plot the roots on the complex plane. You may label this
   by hand. For each system below, determine whether the system is stable, unstable, or critically
   stable.  If the system is unstable, identify the type of instability

   #. :math:`\dot{x}+10x=0`
   #. :math:`\dot{x}-10x=0`
   #. :math:`-\dot{x}-10x=0`
   #. :math:`-\dot{x}+10x=0`
   #. :math:`1\ddot{x}-1\dot{x}+100x=0`
   #. :math:`1\ddot{x}+1\dot{x}-100x=0`
   #. :math:`1\ddot{x}-1\dot{x}-100x=0`

#. Plot the phase diagrams (:math:`\dot{x}` versus :math:`x`) for the
   following system/s and identify stability, linearity, equilibrium
   points (and their stability qualities).

   #. :math:`\dot{x}+x=0`
   #. :math:`10\ddot{x}+1\dot{x}+100x=0`
   #. :math:`\dot{x}+x-0.5 x^3=0`
      
#. Plot the phase diagram for the following system/s for a range of
   parameters (the greek characters). Discuss how changing the
   paramters influence the behavior  of the system and the stability
   properties of the system.

   #. :math:`\ddot{x}=-\mu(x^2-1)\dot{x}-x`
